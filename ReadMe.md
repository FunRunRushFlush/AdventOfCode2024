# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

My first attempt at [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges, implemented in C# as a learning experience.

## About

This is my first year participating in Advent of Code. As a beginner programmer, I'm using this challenge to:
- Learn C# programming
- Learn basic Datastructures 
- Practice problem-solving skills
- Get familiar with Benchmarking 

## Project Structure

The solution contains:
- `2024/` - Main solution code for each day
- `2024.Test/` - Unit tests
- Each day's solution is in its own folder (Day01-Day25)
